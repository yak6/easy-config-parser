# About
This parser was written to simply load variables from a file. It has only two main functions, load and replace. If you enjoyed this project leave a star!
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
# How to use
Next to your Python script put *loader.py*, now in your script import this using `import loader`.
If you want to load something use `load("value name", "file name")`, for replacing use `replace("value name", NewValue, "file name")`. 
The example file is located in the repository under the name *data.anything*.
